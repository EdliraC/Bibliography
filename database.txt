Early data management systems were based on techniques from several classical areas of computer science, ranging from hardware and operating systems to data structures and programming languages. In the early seventies, a leap of abstraction from file systems produced relational databases and its accompanying theory, with logic as the catalyst.')

(as defined above) is the part of this study known as symbolic logic. Symbolic
logic is a branch of mathematics. Like other areas of mathematics, symbolic logic

logic was to provide a foundation for mathematics. Today, foundational studies
are just one part of symbolic logic.')
